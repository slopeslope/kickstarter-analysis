# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
The smaller the kickstarter fund was, the higher the percentage of success. This is obvious considering the smaller amount of money the easier it is to attain. 
Quarters 1 and 2 of the year are the best time to start a kickstarter.
A setback would be that there is not enough information on why a kickstarter is successful, just that it was successful. There could be a multitude of reasons a kickstarter was successful besides outcome and launch date. 
The best course of action, in my opinion based on this data, would be to start a campaign of a fund between 10,000 and 14,999 because it's the highest amount above a 50% success rate.
